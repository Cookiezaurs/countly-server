# Security Policy

Security is very important to us. If you discover any issue regarding security, please disclose the information responsibly by sending an email to security@count.ly and not by creating a GitHub issue.

All software related security bugs with severity of medium and higher will be awarded accordingly with a bug bounty reward.

Due to on premise nature of our software, all server configuration related issues will be reported to related departments/parties/companies, but we cannot guarantee any bounty rewards for them.
